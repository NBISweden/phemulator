___________________________________________

Datafiles for the red deer on Rum study population (Rum_recoded_repos) and the Argyll sample dataset (Argyll_repos) in plink readble format. SNP_cM_positions.txt details estimated SNP positions in centimorgans. 



Files are in plink readable format: .bed .bim .fam and can be used for analysis in plink or other software that takes such file format. Files are post quality control as detailed in main text.

RED DEER PROJECT DATA REUSE:
#########################
The attached file(s) contain data derived from the long term field project
monitoring individual red deer on Rum and their environment.  This is a request to please let us know if you use them.  
Several people have spent the best part of their careers collecting the data.  
If you plan to analyse the data, there are a number of reasons why it would be very helpful if you could contact Loeske Kruuk (loeske.kruuk@ed.ac.uk) before doing so.

[NB. If you are interested in analysing the detailed project data in any depth 
you may find it helpful to have our full relational database rather than the
file(s) available here.  If so, then we have a simple process for bringing you
onto the project as a collaborator.]

1) The data can be subject to change due to updates in the pedigree, merging of
records, occasional errors and so on.

2) The data are complex and workers who do not know the study system may
benefit from advice when interpreting it.

3) At any one time a number of people within the existing project collaboration
are analysing data from this project. Someone else may already be conducting
the analysis you have in mind and it is desirable to prevent duplication of
effort.

4) In order to maintain funding for the project(s), every few years we have to
write proposals for original analyses to funding agencies. It is therefore very
helpful for those running the project to know what data analyses are in
progress.

5) Individual identifiers may vary relative to other data archives from papers using
the individual-level data.
